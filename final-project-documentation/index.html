                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>This project is mainly inspired by “World Wind Radio”(https://www.creativeapplications.net/member-submissions/world-wind-radio/). This project detects the direction of the wind and broadcasts the local broadcast of the place where the wind blows. The project aims to call for a connection between people from different countries, which is very touching to me.</p>
                <p>In order to achieve this goal, I studied the its principle. It first detects the wind direction through arduino, then selects the area where the wind blows in a map, triggering online broadcasting through the music player Deamon, and finally displays the location, country and broadcasting on the LCD screen.

                    Combined with another project “Buttons[2]”(A camera that only takes pictures of people's cameras nearby). Combined with another project, I came up with the original vision for my project. I want to make a small device that  that can send voice(and transferred to text) to strangers. Of course, to make it more interesting, the two people who receive and send are determined according to the direction of the wind, making this project more poetic, that is, "the wind blows information on where to come.”
                    
                    So the whole project involves the use of arduino, Api (weather information), p5 serial communication and server. </p>

                <p>I have divided this project into several parts:
                   </p>

                    <p>First I implemented the API connection in p5.js, no additional library is included in this step. </p>
                    <p>Second, I combined it with the speech recognition code, which requires the p5.speech.js library, but thanks to shiffman's source code, I modified it a bit and combined it with the code for getting the API, so getting the api is useful Detected that I said "triggered by Good morning".</p>
                         <p>Third, I run a serialport server, first in the terminal npm install, then node startserver.js.
                            In this step, I first made a demo. When I click on the screen, the small light will be on, which proves that the signal can be transmitted from p5.js to arduino(must work with the server running!).
                            In arduino, the LED light is controlled by the high and low signal from p5.js.</p>
                            <p> Finally,just change the code in arduino as output with a PCB library “Adafruit_Thermal Printer Library”. Create an if conditional judgment to control whether to print.
                     </p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>The serial connection is stable,but at this stage it also relies on local server for signaling. 

                    Out of my love for traveling alone, my ultimate goal is definitely to hope that it can become a portable device which users can take it out, and then say hello or send messages to strangers in the direction of the wind, maybe at that time this title of project might be more poetic. After all, my project was originally set up based on emotional connection. Of course, this idea may need to design the app interface of the mobile phone or realize it through the wifi module.
                    
                    In order to make it more convenient to carry, I will use arduino nano to replace uno in the future, and make a smaller package to cover arduino components. I think the problem of server can be solved by the built-in microphone of the mobile phone, but after all, I hope that my works can involve the use of mobile phone screens as little as possible (when traveling)
                    I like the form of thermal printers very much. I prefer to record texts rather than photos. I believe some people will resonate with me.
                    
                    Finally, it should be mentioned that my API-key is a one-month subscription right.</p>
